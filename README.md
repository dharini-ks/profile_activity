The Profile Activity in this Android application is designed to showcase the user’s personal and financial information in a clean, organized, and user-friendly interface. It displays essential details such as the user’s name, credit score, bank balance, rewards, and cashback amounts. The layout is built to be responsive and intuitive, ensuring that users can easily navigate through their profile data on various screen sizes and device types.

Key Features
Dynamic and Reusable UI Components:
The activity uses reusable layout components to display profile details in a structured manner. Often, a RecyclerView is implemented to efficiently render dynamic rows, allowing easy addition or modification of profile items without redesigning the entire UI.

Profile Image Selection:
Users can personalize their profile by selecting a profile image directly from the device gallery. This feature uses Android’s intent system to open the gallery app and handle the image result, providing a seamless image picking experience.

Editable User Name:
The activity allows users to update their display name. This editable feature supports direct input with real-time validation to ensure the entered name meets required criteria.

Persistent Data Storage with SharedPreferences:
User inputs such as the profile image URI and edited name are stored locally using Android’s SharedPreferences. This ensures that user customizations persist across app restarts without needing a backend connection.

Data Integration:
While the profile data can be preloaded or updated from local storage, the design supports integration with remote APIs or databases to fetch real-time financial information like credit score and bank balance, making the profile both dynamic and secure.

Modern UI/UX Practices:
The interface follows Material Design guidelines, employing responsive layouts, smooth animations, and accessible controls to provide an engaging and consistent user experience.

How It Works
Upon launching the Profile Activity, user details are loaded either from local storage (SharedPreferences) or fetched from a remote source. The profile picture, name, and financial details are displayed in a clean card-like structure. Users can tap the profile image to open the gallery and select a new picture, which is then displayed immediately and saved persistently. Similarly, the name field is editable, with changes saved locally upon confirmation.

The use of RecyclerView for profile information rows allows for scalable and maintainable UI code, easily adapting to changes in the type or amount of data show
